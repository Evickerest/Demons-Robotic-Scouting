Scouting webpage for FRC Robotics

(This is designed to be for phones)

  This project is for a robotics team. During a robotic compeition, there are 2 stages: The qualification matches and the tournament. The top teams from the qualification matches become "alliance captains" and pick two other teams each to form "alliances". However, in order to succeed, you have to pick good teammates that will complement your robot. 
  To do this, you have to "scout" data during the qualification matches. This involves having people watching matches, and recording data. Previous years this team has just used a google form, but I have been tasked with designing an application that can be used easily, and record data.
